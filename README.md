### 👤 About Me

I’m **Muhammad Saqib**, a BSIT student in my 6th semester who genuinely enjoys building websites that actually help people.  
My first web project made me realize how exciting it is to turn an idea into something real. Since then, I have worked on both frontend and backend projects, improving my skills one step at a time.  
I have completed two internships at **Appaura (Frontend)** and **TechTommy (Backend)**, working with React.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.  
I’m now eager to grow as a **Full Stack Developer** and contribute to building impactful, user-focused solutions.
